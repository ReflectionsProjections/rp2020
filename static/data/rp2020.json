The competition dates and times will be announced soon! The competition will conclude with the closing ceremony and awards presentation, and will be livestreamed on twitch.tv. You must be registered for Reflections | Projections to compete in MechMania."

            "answer": "No prior knowledge of any specific languages are required. You won't need a background in artificial intelligence—in previous years, many teams without an AI background have competed and done well, or even won. You also shouldn't need knowledge of network programming beyond HTTP requests."

You may, however, bring non-code items like rc files, build scripts, notes, etc. Competitors are required to bring their own laptops, though the code you write must be capable of running on our systems."

Our API will provide you information about the current state of the game, as well as allow you to send commands to play it. You may find previous competition sites useful to get an idea of how MechMania operates."

A number of letters in the alphabet, number of cards in a deck, all the US state abbreviations, and silly other things that you've probably run across in your daily life. Some awareness of the recent memes and popular culture will probably be helpful. Knowledge of current events at UIUC and the campus layout will be really helpful."

R|P originated as the Midwestern ACM Chapter Conference back in 1995 and this year we are aiming to bring all our neighboring Midwestern chapters together to facilitate collaboration and conversation. All our chapters are doing incredible research and building really cool projects and we would be remiss if we couldn't shine a spotlight on it."

            "question": "Why should I attend?",

With an audience consisting of fellow ACM chapter members, students attending from 10+ Midwestern universities, professors and researchers of UIUC themselves and other conference attendees and speakers, who know what opportunities might present themselves?"
